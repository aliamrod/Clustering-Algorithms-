Many online retailers and new entrants to the online retail sector are keen to practice data mining and consumer-centric marketing in their business practices, 
yet technically lack the necessary knowledge and expertise to do so. In this project, a case study of using data mining techniques in customer-centric
business intelligence for an online retailer is presented. The main purpose of this analysis is to help the business better understand its customers and therefore
conduct customer-centric marketing more effectively. On the basis of the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary model, customers of the business have been segmented using the k-means clustering algorithm and decision 
tree induction, and the main characteristics of the consumers in each semgent have been clearly identified. Accordingly, a set of recommendatins is further provide to the business on consumer-centric marketing.


This is a real-world data science scenario, where we dive into data concerning customer behavior using K-Means Algorithm to profile their preferences and segment them into distinct groups based on shared characteristics, enabling targeted 
marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences. We focus on three key features -- (1) Recency-how many days since last purchase,
(2) Frequency-how many total purchases has client made, and (3) Monetary value- sum total of monetary contribution client has made. Thus, we use RFM analysis aiming to discover patterns in existing data concerning customer behavior; k means helps us separate 
these behaviors into meaningful groups using features of RFM.
