The flowchart illustrates the steps for selecting and building machine learning models. (1) Understand the problem type. Determine whether the task is regression, classification, or clustering, (2) Analyze data characteristics. Examine the data size, feature types, relationships, and distribution, (3) Select an appropriate model. Choose a model suited to the problem type and data properties, (4) Preprocess and engineer features. Perform tasks like scaling, encoding, and handle missing values, (5) Build and train the model. Split the data, train the model, and optimize hyperparameters, (6) Evaluate and interpret resuls. Use metrics to assess performance and interpret outcomes.

This repository explore clustering algorithms, which are used to group data points into clusters. Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some specific sense defined by the analyst) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory data analysis, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning.

Cluster analysis refers to a family of algorithms and tasks rather than one specific algorithm. It can be achieved by various algorithms that differ significantly in their understanding of what constitutes a cluster and how to efficiently find them. Popular notions of clusters include groups with small distances between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular statistical distributions. Clustering can therefore be formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. The appropriate clustering algorithm and parameter settings (including parameters such as the distance function to use, a density threshold or the number of expected clusters) depend on the individual data set and intended use of the results. Cluster analysis as such is not an automatic task, but an iterative process of knowledge discovery or interactive multi-objective optimization that involves trial and failure. It is often necessary to modify data preprocessing and model parameters until the result achieves the desired properties.

## B. Selecting and building appropriate ML models (e.g., regression, classification, clustering) based on the problem and data characteristics).

### a. Regression 

 Regression = to predict continuous numerical values. Use cases include:
 * Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, etc.
 * Forecasting future sales, stock prices, or other continuous outcomes.
 * Estimating the likelihood or probability of a continuous variable.
 * Modeling relationships between independent variables and a continuous dependent variable.
 * Example Algorithms: Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR).

 
### b. Classification

Classification = To predict categorical labels or classes. Use cases include:
* Identifying whether an email is spam or not.
* Predicting the type of disease (i.e. cancer diagnosis, binary classification: healthy vs. sick).
* Predicting customer churn, loan approval, or product recommendation (multi-class classification).
* Detecting sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral).
* Example Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes.
  

### c. Clustering

Clustering = Clustering is a type of unsupervised ML technique used to group similar data points together based on their inherent characteristics. The goal is to organize data into clusters such that: (1) Intra-cluster similarity (data points within the same cluster are as similar as possible) and (2) Inter-cluster dissimilarity (data points in different clusters are as distinct as possible). Clustering is widely used when labels or categories for the data are not pre-defined. It helps in identifying patterns, structures, or groupings in data without prior knowledge. 

Key features of clustering include (1) unsupervised learning. No labeled data is required; the algorithm discovers the groupings. (2) Similarity/dissimilarity metrics. Clustering relies on measures like Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, or other metrics to assess how data points are grouped. (3) Applications. Clustering is used in various domains, including customer segmentation, image segmentation, anomaly detection, and document categorization. *For example, suppose you have a dataset with customer purchase histories. A clustering algorithm can group customers into clusters based on their buying behaviors, such as Cluster_1: frequent small purchases, Cluster_2: Rare large purchases, Cluster_3: Moderate and consistent purchases. These clusters can then be used to tailor marketing strategies or improve customer service.


Types of Clustering Algorithms:
* Centroid-Based Algorithms
 	+ K-Means: Clusters are represented by centroids, and the algorithm minimizes the within-cluster sum of squares. Pros: (1) Simplicity. Easy to understand and implement, (2) Efficiency. Scales well to large datasets; computationally efficient for spherical, well-separated clusters, (3) Fast convergence. Works quickly for datasets with distinct clusters. Cons: (1) Sensitivity to initialization. The outcome depends heavily on the initial centroids, (2) Predefined 'K' value. Requires the number of clusters (K) to be defined upfront, (3) Shape limitations. Struggles with non-spherical or overlapping clusters, (4) Outlier sensitivity. Outliers can skew the centroids significantly.
	+ K-Medoids: Similar to K-Means but uses actual data points (medoids) as cluster centers, making it more robust to outliers. "Medoids" instead of "Centroids" representating clustering; medoid = center point within cluster minimizing sum of distances to other points. Unlike K-Means, which is sensitive to outliers due to centroids being influenced by the mean of the data, K-Medoids assigns each data point to the nearest medoid _mi_, which is an actual data point in the dataset. This makes K-Medoids more robust to outliers, as medoids minimize the sum of dissimilarities (e.g., distances) between all data points in the cluster and the medoid, rather than relying on the arithmetic mean.



* Density-Based Algorithms
	+ DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): Identifies clusters based on the density of points in the data, works well for non-spherical clusters and handles noise effectively.
	+ OPTICS (Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering Structure): Similar to DBSCAN but can identify clusters with varying densities;no fixed ϵ.

* Hierarchical Clustering
	+ Agglomeramative Clustering: Starts with each data point as its own cluster and merges clusters iteratively.
  	+ Divisive Clustering: Starts with one cluster and splits it iteratively (often visualized using dendograms). 
* Distribution-Based Algorithms
	+ Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs): Assumes that data is generated from a mixture of Gaussian distributions and uses probabilistic assignments for clustering.
	  
* Grid-Based Algorithms
	+ CLIQUE (Clustering in Quest): Partitions the data space into a grid structure and clusters the dense regions.
	+ STING (Statistical Information Grid): Divides the space into a hierarchical grid for clustering.
* Spectral Clustering
* Fuzzy Clustering
* Model-Based Clustering
* Constraint-Based Clustering
* Deep Learning-Based Clustering
  


5. Grid-Based Algorithms
CLIQUE (Clustering in Quest): Partitions the data space into a grid structure and clusters the dense regions.
STING (Statistical Information Grid): Divides the data space into a hierarchical grid for clustering.
6. Spectral Clustering
Uses the eigenvalues of the similarity matrix of the data to perform dimensionality reduction before clustering, often applied to non-linear cluster structures.
7. Fuzzy Clustering
Fuzzy C-Means: Allows data points to belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of membership.
8. Model-Based Clustering
Algorithms like Expectation-Maximization (EM) focus on fitting data into statistical models, often Gaussian distributions.
9. Constraint-Based Clustering
Uses additional constraints or prior knowledge, such as must-link or cannot-link constraints, to guide the clustering process.
10. Deep Learning-Based Clustering
Autoencoder-Based Clustering: Uses neural networks to learn lower-dimensional embeddings and clusters the data in this space.
Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs): A type of neural network trained to produce a low-dimensional representation of input data.
