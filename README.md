The flowchart illustrates the steps for selecting and building machine learning models. (1) Understand the problem type. Determine whether the task is regression, classification, or clustering, (2) Analyze data characteristics. Examine the data size, feature types, relationships, and distribution, (3) Select an appropriate model. Choose a model suited to the problem type and data properties, (4) Preprocess and engineer features. Perform tasks like scaling, encoding, and handle missing values, (5) Build and train the model. Split the data, train the model, and optimize hyperparameters, (6) Evaluate and interpret resuls. Use metrics to assess performance and interpret outcomes.

Some examples of clustering algorithms include:
- K-means clustering: a centroid model that represents each cluster with a single mean vector.

PROS
Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement.
Efficiency: Scales well to large datasets; computationally efficient for spherical, well-separated clusters.
Fast Convergence: Works quickly for datasets with distinct clusters.

CONS
Sensitivity to Initialization: The outcome depends heavily on the initial centroids.
Predefined K: Requires the number of clusters (K) to be defined upfront.
Shape Limitations: Struggles with non-spherical or overlapping clusters.
Outlier Sensitivity: Outliers can skew the centroids significantly.
- Hierarchical clustering: a connectivity model that builds models based on distance connectivity.
Pros:

Hierarchical View: Provides a dendrogram that helps visualize how clusters are formed.
No K Required: Does not require a predefined number of clusters.
Flexible: Works for various distance metrics and linkage methods.
Cons:

Scalability Issues: Computationally expensive for large datasets, as it requires O(n^2) memory and time.
Irreversibility: Once a split or merge is made, it cannot be undone.
Sensitivity to Noise: Outliers can distort the hierarchy significantly.
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): a density model that defines clustering as a connected dense region in data space.
- Spectral clustering: an algorithm that uses spectral embeddings, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors to segment images, detect communities, and reduce dimensionality.
Pros:
- Effective for Complex Structures: Can identify clusters with non-convex boundaries.
- Dimensionality Reduction: Leverages eigenvalues and eigenvectors for efficient clustering in reduced dimensions.
- Versatility: Works for a wide range of applications, including image segmentation and community detection.

Cons:
- Scalability: Computationally expensive for large datasets due to eigen decomposition.
- Parameter Sensitivity: Requires careful tuning of similarity and graph construction parameters.
- Lack of Interpretability: The algorithm’s reliance on spectral embeddings makes it less intuitive.

Other Clustering Algorithms to Consider:
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): Probabilistic clustering that models data as a mixture of Gaussian distributions.
Pros: Handles overlapping clusters; probabilistic output.
Cons: Assumes Gaussian distribution; computationally intensive.

Agglomerative Clustering: A variant of hierarchical clustering that merges clusters iteratively.
Pros: Similar to hierarchical clustering; customizable linkage metrics.
Cons: Similar scalability and sensitivity issues as hierarchical clustering.

OPTICS (Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering Structure):
Pros: Handles clusters of varying densities; no fixed ϵ.
Cons: More complex than DBSCAN.


A. Descriptive Statistics & Hypothesis Testing: Apply statistical methods (e.g., descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing) to understand data distributions, relationships, and draw meaningful conclusions.

Descriptive Statistics: 
  Purpose = Summarize and understand the central tendency, dispersion (ie means the extent to which numerical data is likely to vary about an average value), and distribution of data. 

Understanding the Data: 
1. Data Overview
2. Data Cleaning
3.
