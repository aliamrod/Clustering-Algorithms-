Many online retailers and new entrants to the online retail sector are keen to practice data mining and consumer-centric marketing in their business practices, 
yet technically lack the necessary knowledge and expertise to do so. In this project, a case study of using data mining techniques in customer-centric
business intelligence for an online retailer is presented. The main purpose of this analysis is to help the business better understand its customers and therefore
conduct customer-centric marketing more effectively. On the basis of the Recency, Frequency, and Monetary model, customers of the business have been segmented using the k-means clustering algorithm and decision 
tree induction, and the main characteristics of the consumers in each semgent have been clearly identified. Accordingly, a set of recommendatins is further provide to the business on consumer-centric marketing.


This is a real-world data science scenario, where we dive into data concerning customer behavior using K-Means Algorithm to profile their preferences and segment them into distinct groups based on shared characteristics, enabling targeted 
marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences. We focus on three key features -- (1) Recency-how many days since last purchase,
(2) Frequency-how many total purchases has client made, and (3) Monetary value- sum total of monetary contribution client has made. Thus, we use RFM analysis aiming to discover patterns in existing data concerning customer behavior; k means helps us separate 
these behaviors into meaningful groups using features of RFM.

Compared with traditional shopping in retail stores, online shopping has some unique characteristics: each customer's shopping process and activities can be tracked instantaneously and accurately, each customer's order is usually associted with a delivery address and a billing address, and each customer has an online store account with essential contact and payment information.

In relation to customer-centric business intelligence, online retailers are usually concerned with the following common business concerns:
* Which items/products’ web pages has a customer visited? How long has a customer stayed with each web page, and in which sequence has a customer visited a set of products’ web pages?
* Who are the most/least valuable customers to the business? What are the distinct characteristics of them?
* Who are the most/least loyal customers, and how are they characterized?
* What are customers’ purchase behaviour patterns? Which products/items have customers purchased together often? In which sequence the products have been purchased?
* Which types of customers are more likely to respond to a certain promotion mailing?
* What are the sales patterns in terms of various perspectives such as products/items, regions and time (weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly and seasonally), and so on?

Conclusion

It has been shown that there are two steps in the whole data mining process that are crucial and the most time-consuming: data preparation and model interpretation and evaluation. Further research for the business inccludes: conducting association analysis to establish customer buying patterns with regard to which products have been purchased together frequently by which customers and which customer groups; enhancing the merchant's web site to enable a consumer's shopping activities to be captured and tracked instantaneously and accurately; and predicting each customer's lifecycle value to quantify the level of diversity of each customer.
